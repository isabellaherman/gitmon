Gitmon is an open-source experiment that turns your commits and contributions into evolving monsters. Built with Next.js, GitHub API, and a bit of chaos.

If you’re into game design, systems, or balancing you can dive into how Gitmon is designed to work at https://www.gitmon.xyz/docs.

# 🧾 License & Usage

Gitmon’s source code is open and free to explore.
You can read it, fork it, learn from it, or build on top of it. Just **don’t** reuse the GitMonster characters, images, or names outside of this project.

All art, character designs, and names are © Gitmon.xyz — not for commercial or personal redistribution.

# 🧩 Own a GitMonster

You can support the project (and have some fun with it) by owning a GitMonster and its IP, meaning that you get the rights to that specific character (its name, design, and identity) to use in your own projects, branding, or creative work, including commercial use and monetized projects.

Owning a GitMon also allows you to sponsor your name, project, or link on dedicated GitMon screens, shown alongside the monster’s stats in places like the Character Selection and GitDex pages. (WIP)

Some monsters include editable files for customization, others are sealed artworks.
Either way, you get a lifetime IP license for that character and its name.

Only 9 GitMon slots will be available for ownership and project support — released one at a time.
Get in touch if you’re interested, or just keep an eye on the website for updates.
